AboutAbout
Born and brought up in Bhopal, the city of lakes, I have enjoyed living in locations
around the world, including the United States.
The opportunity to pursue Masters from Penn State University, USA, gave me a
chance to observe the various sectors and new perspectives outside India. I believe
in adopting learnings and ideas to bring change. So, I started working towards health
and education, the most significant areas impacting a person’s life and society.
I started the ToneOp Health & Nutrition App in 2019 when the world manifested the most
advanced threat, COVID-19. I wanted to provide an interface where people could
manage their health and lifestyle with expert intervention but without physical human
interaction. The idea was to provide the easiest way to help people achieve their
health goals while managing their day-to-day activities.
I am also leading the Bansal News, one of the best media platforms in central India,
and Bansal Group Of Institutes, one of MP's leading groups of institutions.
